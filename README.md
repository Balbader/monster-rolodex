# Monsters-rolodex

My repo for the ZTM React Developer course: udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery

This repo covers only the Monsters Rolodex project in the course.

The goal of this project is to get a better understanding of: <br>
• how React Components work.
• difference between State and Props
• the `this` keyword
• arrow function methods in classes
• naming files
• basic app structure
