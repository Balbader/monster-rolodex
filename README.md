# Monsters-rolodex

My repo for the ZTM React Developer course: udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery

This repo covers only the Monsters Rolodex project in the course.

The goal of this project is to get a better understanding of: <br>
• how React Components work.<br>
• difference between State and Props<br>
• the `this` keyword<br>
• arrow function methods in classes<br>
• naming files<br>
• basic app structure<br>
