# Monsters-rolodex

My repo for the ZTM React Developer course: udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery

This repo covers only the Monsters Rolodex project in the course.

The purpose of this repo is for students to have an additional source to check their code against (in addition to the instructor's original source code).
